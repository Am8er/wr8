# wr8

[wr8](https://wr8.in) lets you create a website in Notion with better SEO. It is a customized version of [nextjs-notion-starter-kit](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit), based on [NotionX](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x).

## Introduction

The wr8 website template is minimal and SEO-focused, a combo many bloggers and writers prefer. You can set it up within 10 minutes if you have accounts on Notion (obviously), GitHub, and Vercel. Additionally, you can add any analytics scripts you prefer.

## Features, getting started, and more

Visit: [https://wr8.in/](https://wr8.in/)

## Free wr8.in subdomain

I'd be happy to provide custom subdomain mapping. Feel free to point your Vercel project to <code>example.wr8.in</code> of your choice. Available on [request](https://tally.so/r/3Npa5l). wr8.in domain registration is valid till 2032, so you're in safe hands for at least ten years.

## Warranty

wr8 comes with no warranty whatsoever. I'm not a full-time developer and am not well versed in React. I've shown you what you can do with wr8. Take it up a notch if you like.

## Donations

I didn't create the original React renderer. You can fork the wr8 repo and do whatever with it. And if you really enjoy using wr8 out of the box, [donations](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/verfasor) are appreciated. Alternatively, you could consider buying my [music](https://signalsiren.bandcamp.com/) to show support. I make synthwave and electronica in general. Thank you.
